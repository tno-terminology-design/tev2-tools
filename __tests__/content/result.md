This file includes test situations used as a mockup to test the Terminology Design Tools.
During testing, all of the tools are ran and this file is compared to the [expected result](result.md).
All of the tools are ran according to the [terminology-config.yaml](terminology-config.yaml) config file.

The following steps are executed:
1. The MRG-Import Tool is ran to import the MRG's from the [tev2-specifications](https://github.com/tno-terminology-design/tev2-specifications/tree/main/docs) repository.
2. The MRGT is ran to generate the MRG files according to the [SAF](saf.yaml), and updates the published [mrg.tev2-tools.yaml](glossaries/mrg.tev2-tools.yaml) file.
3. The HRGT is given this file as input, generates the glossaries in the [HRGT](#hrgt) section, and outputs the file.
4. The TRRT is given the output file of the HRGT as input, converts the term references into renderable references, and outputs the file.
