# Property (of a Concept)

A **property (of a [concept](@))** is a connection or association between that [concept](@) and a primitive data element, such as a text, a number, a boolean value, etc., that represents some characteristic that (instances of) the [concept](@) may have.

Where [relations](@) describe connections or associations between [concepts](@), properties describe characteristics of [concepts](@) in terms of data attributes or values.

Properties are crucial for capturing and representing specific characteristics, attributes, or features of [concepts](@) in a model. They enable the inclusion of essential metadata and descriptive information associated with [concepts](@).

## Examples

1. In a product database, the "Price" property relates the "Product" concept to a numeric value representing its cost.
2. The "Color" property of an "Apple" concept links it to a text value indicating its visual appearance.
3. "Gender" can be a property of a "Person" (or "Animal") concept, as can "being a parent".

## Notes

- Properties play a significant role in enriching the conceptual model with detailed attribute information for each concept.
- Defining properties accurately is essential for maintaining consistency and accuracy in the conceptual model.
