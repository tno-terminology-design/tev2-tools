# Curate

**Curate**: to select, organize, and present [terms](@), [definitions](@), and other, related content in a thoughtful and purposeful manner to establish shared understanding among a [community](@) working together on a particular set of objectives. The act of curation involves careful consideration of the relevance, clarity, and context of the [concepts](@) and their [definitions](@), ensuring that they are unambiguous and effectively support communication and collaboration within the [community](@).

### Notes

Curation plays a vital role in establishing and maintaining terminologies within a community's scope. Through careful curation, communities can ensure that their terminology remains consistent and facilitates effective communication among members. The process of curating a terminology involves defining concepts and their associated criteria, promoting shared understanding, and providing clear guidelines for using the terms consistently.
