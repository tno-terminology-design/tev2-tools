# Reader

An **Reader** is a person that reads a text that is authored by another person (its [author](@)]), and that tries to understand the meaning of this text in the way its [author](@) intended.

It is vital that the message that the [author](@) intends to convey gets across. Whitepapers, opinion papers, specifications, standardization texts, advertisements, memo's, mails, etc. could just as well not have been written if the intended readers do not pick up the meaning of that meaning.

For us, high-quality texts do not require their readers to 'hallucinate', i.e. make assumptions so as to understand the intentions of their [author](@). Such texts are typically well-suited for specifications, standards, educational materials etc. However, there are also situations in which this kind of quality is not necessary (e.g., in management summaries, or casual notes), or even counter-productive (e.g., in advertisements).
