# Moustache Variable

A **moustache variable** is a placeholder in the form of a 'moustache' tag, e.g. `{{variable_name}}``, within some text. They are used, e.g., by the [TRRT](@), where they get their values from an [interpreter](@), and where they are used in a selected [converter](@) for the purpose of replacing [TermRefs](@) with [renderable refs](@).

## Notes

- Moustache variables serve as dynamic placeholders that allow flexible text transformation based on extracted information.
- The use of moustache variables enables separation of concerns between data extraction and text conversion.
