# Ingestion (Process)

**Ingestion** (or the **ingestion process**) is the process that is run by a [terms-community](@), in which their members suggest, draft, and discuss [definitions](@) ([terms](@) + [criteria](@)) that are relevant for a particular [scope](@), and converting such contributions into [curated texts](@) that accurately document the [concepts](@) and other [terminologic artifacts](@) and that adhere to the [TEv2-specifications](/docs/spec-files/ctext).

It is typical that some of the members of the [terms-community](@) are the [curators](@) of the [scope](@) for which the [terminology](@) is being suggested, discussed and maintained.

It is also typical that the members make their contributions in various ways, e.g., using wiki-pages, confluence pages, Google Docs, Word docs, etc. It is important that the members of the [terms-community](@) and the [curators](@) find ways to not only decide on what goes into the [terminology](@), but also how to efficiently convert such contributions into [curated texts](@) that comply with the [specifications](/docs/spec-files/ctext). The [TEv2 architecture](/docs/overview/tev2-architecture) acknowledges that this may require some specific tools, which is referred to as the 'ingress toolbox'.

## Examples

1. In a collaborative terminology project, community members contribute new terms and their definitions through wiki-pages. The ingestion process involves reviewing these contributions and transforming them into curated texts for incorporation into the glossary.
2. The ingestion process may require the use of specialized tools to convert Google Docs' content into standardized curated texts with consistent formatting and metadata.

## Notes

- The ingestion process plays a vital role in continuously updating and expanding the terminology to reflect the evolving needs of the community.
- Effective ingestion ensures that the curated texts are up-to-date and aligned with the specifications for consistent and standardized terminology management.
